## Features

- Real-time detection of malicious URLs.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.
- Integration with machine learning models for high accuracy.
- Animated descriptions to improve user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with Chakra UI for styling and responsive design.
- **Backend**: Node.js (or other relevant technology, if applicable).
- **Machine Learning**: Pretrained models for detecting malicious URLs.
- **Libraries**:
  - `framer-motion` for animations.
  - `chakra-ui` for UI components.
- **Deployment**: (Specify deployment method/platform if applicable).

## How It Works

1. Users input a URL into the provided form.
2. The URL is analyzed using machine learning models hosted on the backend.
3. The results indicate whether the URL is safe or potentially malicious.
4. A detailed explanation of the detection process is presented.
